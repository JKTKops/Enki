gcd of A and B is
    when B = 0 then A.
    otherwise then
        A = B*X + M, M >= 0, M < B,
        gcd of B and M.

lcm A B is A * B / gcd of A and B.

list lcm of List is
    when List = cons H T then lcm H (list lcm of T).
    otherwise then 1.

display as text the list lcm of the integers from 1 to 20.
