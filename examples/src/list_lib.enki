list may be
    empty.
    cons Head Tail has
        Head : int,
        Tail : list.

length of List is
    when List = cons H T then 1 + length of T.
    otherwise then 0.

construct Head Full is
    Full = (cons Head Tail),
    Tail.

sum List is N where
    when List = cons H T then sum T is (N - H).
    otherwise then N = 0.
