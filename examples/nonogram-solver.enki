board may be
    board Rows has Rows : list (list int).

head (cons X Xs) is X.

tail Xs is
    when Xs = cons H T then T.
    otherwise then empty.

transpose Xs is
    when Xs = empty then empty.
    when Xs = cons empty T then transpose T.
    otherwise then prepend (map head over Xs) to transpose (map tail over Xs).

repeat X N times is
    when N <= 0 then empty.
    otherwise then prepend X to repeat X (N - 1) times.

rows (board Rows) is Rows.
columns (board Rows) is transpose Rows.
