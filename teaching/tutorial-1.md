# Tutorial 1: Introduction

Welcome to the first Enki tutorial!

Enki is a programming language intended for teaching programming.

Let's dive right in by looking at some code with what is probably the most commonly written program ever: Hello World.
This program will simply write the words "Hello world!" to the screen.

```enki
display "Hello world!".
```

Note that this file is executable, you can simply run:

```bash
enki run tutorial-1.md
```

To run all the code in this file.
